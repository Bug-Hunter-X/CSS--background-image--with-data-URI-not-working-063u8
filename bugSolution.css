The problem may stem from the size of the data URI or certain characters within it causing parsing issues in older browsers. As a workaround, try to host the image on a server and use a standard URL path. If the data URI is very large, consider compressing the image before encoding it as a data URI.

Here's an example of using a standard URL:

```css
/*bugSolution.css*/
#myElement {
  background-image: url('https://example.com/myimage.png');
}
```

Alternatively, ensure your data URI is correctly formatted and doesn't exceed browser limits.  If the issue is browser-specific, consider adding vendor prefixes as well:
